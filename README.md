# FriendsPersona: Personality Recognition on Multiparty Dialogue

## Task description

Multiparty Personality Recognition requires machines to determine the main speaker's personality from a short conversation in binary Big Five personality traits:
  - **Agreeableness (AGR)**: trustworthy, straightforward, generous vs. unreliable, complicated, meager, and boastful
  - **Conscientiousness (CON)**: efficient and organized vs. sloppy and careless
  - **Extroversion (EXT)**:  outgoing, talkative, and energetic vs. reserved and solitary
  - **Openness (OPN)**: inventive and curious vs. dogmatic and cautious
  - **Neuroticism (NEU)**: sensitive and nervous vs. secure and confident

This is a part of the [Character Mining](../../../character-mining) project led by the [Emory NLP](http://nlp.mathcs.emory.edu) research group.

## Dataset

To generate the dataset, 711 short conversations are extracted and annotated from the first four seasons of Friends TV Show transcripts. 
There are 6405 unique tokens after pre-processing. 
In each short conversation, we ask three annotators to evaluate a main speaker's personality traits on a scale of -1, 0, 1. 
This task is challenging because only text information is given and might not contain enough information to fully understand the social context.


## Annotation

The following shows a multiparty dialogue between **Monica** and **Paul**. 

<b>s01_e01_c05(0) for Paul</b><br>
<b>Monica Geller</b>: Oh my God!<br>
<b>Paul</b>: I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?<br>
<b>Monica Geller</b>: My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?<br>
<b>Paul</b>: Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-<br>
<b>Monica Geller</b>: -leg?<br>

The scores of 3 annotators are summed up and converted to binary labels using the median split.
This conversation has the following fields:
  - `scene_id`: s01_e01_c05
  - `character`: Paul
  - `AGR`: 1
  - `CON`: 0
  - `EXT`: 1
  - `OPN`: 1
  - `NEU`: 0
  - `text`:

<b>s01_e01_c05(0) for Paul</b><br><br>
<b>Monica Geller</b>: Oh my God!<br><br>
<b>Paul</b>: I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?<br><br>

<b>Paul</b>: Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-<br><br>
<b>Monica Geller</b>: -leg?<br><br>
```

Note: The `text` column consists conversation text strings in simple HTML format. 
  Each text starts with its scene id (e.g. s01_e01_c05) and the main speaker (e.g. Paul).
  Each utterance is separated by `<br><br>` and each speaker is highlighted with `<br></br>`.
